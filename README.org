* Emacs Configuration
** Installation
 - Install *emacs*
 - Download this repository to ~.emacs.d~ folder (in your home directory) \\ 
   ~git clone https://github.com/neppramod/emacs-configuration.git .emacs.d~
 - *Note*: /In windows, home directory is at C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming. AppData folder is hidden by default/ \\
 - I am using *DejaVu Sans Mono-14* fonts (size 14). Change it in configuration.org if you like something else. 
** Details
  - Read [[configuration.org][configuration.org]], and go through each section on how things are set. I believe it is well documented. Github also loads org file in proper displayable format, so it should be easy to follow.
