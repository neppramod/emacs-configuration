* Emacs Configuration
** Installation
 - Install *emacs*
 - Download this repository to ~.emacs.d~ folder (in your home directory) \\ 
   ~git clone https://github.com/neppramod/emacs-configuration.git .emacs.d~
 - *Note*: /In windows, home directory is at C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming. AppData folder is hidden by default/ \\
 - Link or copy ~emacs.muban~ to ~.emacs.muban~ and put it outside *.emacs.d* in home directory. Assuming you are in ~ or AppData directory \\
   ~ln -s .emacs.d/emacs.muban .emacs.muban~
 - Install the font mentioned in [[https://github.com/neppramod/emacs-configuration/blob/master/configuration.org#font][Font section]] of ~configuration.org~
 - Open emacs. Emacs will install required packages and load other settings in ~init.el~ and [[configuration.org][configuration.org]]
 - If emacs prompts for continue connecting? Select *a* (always)
 - Edit a file and make some changes. Save and quit
 - If emacs asks for Save desktop ? Select *y* (yes) (If it asks for a directory, create a blank directory and enter that location)
 
** Details
  - Read [[configuration.org][configuration.org]], and go through each section on how things are set. I believe it is well documented. Github also loads org file in proper displayable format, so it should be easy to follow.
  - Few custom keys are set, and most of them are found in individual ~use-package~ or [[https://github.com/neppramod/emacs-configuration/blob/master/configuration.org#key-bindings][Key bindings section]]. Usage of default keys are listed in individual Notes section and global [[https://github.com/neppramod/emacs-configuration/blob/master/configuration.org#notes-2][Notes]] section.

** Custom Packages
   Following packages require special setup and configuration. Install them
   by following following instruction.

*** Org2Blog
   
   Write blog posts to wordpress with below basic setup
   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
   (use-package org2blog :ensure t)
   (setq org2blog/wp-blog-alist
      '(("<a profile name for this blog>"
         :url "https://<username>.wordpress.com/xmlrpc.php"
         :username "<username>")))
   #+END_SRC

   *Note:* /Here assign a profile and replace <username> with your blog's username/

*** EMMS
    EMMS lets you play media. For this we need to install the player in our system
    before we can configure this. In this example, we need to install ~mplayer~ and
    set its location. In the example below we setup default Music directory also.
    This setup is for very basic music player.

       #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
   (use-package emms
   :ensure t
   :config
   (setq exec-path (append exec-path '("<full path to music player directory>")))
   (emms-standard)
   (emms-default-players)
   (setq emms-source-file-default-directory "~/Music")
   (define-emms-simple-player mplayer '(file url)
      (regexp-opt '(".ogg" ".mp3" ".wav" ".mpg" ".mpeg" ".wmv" ".wma"
                    ".mov" ".avi" ".divx" ".ogm" ".asf" ".mkv" "http://" "mms://"
                    ".rm" ".rmvb" ".mp4" ".flac" ".vob" ".m4a" ".flv" ".ogv" ".pls"))
      "mplayer" "-slave" "-quiet" "-really-quiet" "-fullscreen")
   )
   #+END_SRC
   
   Find out the location of mplayer installation with ~which mplayer~ in terminal, and paste above the directory name where mplayer is located. 
   E.g ~/user/local/bin~ in Mac.
   Also specify where your Music folder is located.
*** Pdf-Tools
    Pdf-tools is a set of packages that allows to view pdf in emacs. 
    Follow [[https://github.com/politza/pdf-tools][instructions here]] to install required packages for pdf-tools in your system.
    Once you install the required packages, you can install pdf-tools in emacs using following setting.
    
    I was having one issue with pdf viewing. When I closed the pdf, next time, it did not
    load the pdf from last position. I found a script, that asks to set the bookmark for current
    pdf file. That is what ~kill-buffer-hook-setup~ does. I also enabled ~pdf-view-midnight-minor-mode~
    so that pdf loads in dark mode.
    
   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

   ;; This allows us to save bookmark while closing pdf
   (defun kill-buffer-hook-setup ()
   (if (and buffer-file-name
   (file-name-extension buffer-file-name)
   (string= (downcase (file-name-extension buffer-file-name)) "pdf")
   (yes-or-no-p "Set bookmark with current file name?"))
   (bookmark-set (file-name-nondirectory buffer-file-name) nil)))

   (use-package pdf-tools
   :pin manual ;; manually update
   :config
   ;; initialise
   (pdf-tools-install)
   ;; open pdfs scaled to fit page
   (setq-default pdf-view-display-size 'fit-page)
   ;; automatically annotate highlights
   (setq pdf-annot-activate-created-annotations t)
   ;; use normal isearch
   (define-key pdf-view-mode-map (kbd "C-s") 'isearch-forward)
   ;; turn off cua so copy works
   (add-hook 'pdf-view-mode-hook (lambda () (cua-mode 0)))
   ;; save pdf at kill
   (add-hook 'kill-buffer-hook 'kill-buffer-hook-setup)
   ;; midnight node by default
   (add-hook 'pdf-tools-enabled-hook 'pdf-view-midnight-minor-mode)
   ;; more fine-grained zooming
   (setq pdf-view-resize-factor 1.1)
   ;; keyboard shortcuts
   (define-key pdf-view-mode-map (kbd "h") 'pdf-annot-add-highlight-markup-annotation)
   (define-key pdf-view-mode-map (kbd "t") 'pdf-annot-add-text-annotation)
   (define-key pdf-view-mode-map (kbd "D") 'pdf-annot-delete))
      #+END_SRC
   Once you add above setting, and load the file and after that call ~M-x pdf-tools-install~ if you see similar error message as below
   
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   /Users/<username>/.emacs.d/elpa/pdf-tools-20200512.1524/build/server/autobuild -i /Users/<username>/.emacs.d/elpa/pdf-tools-20200512.1524/
Failed to recognize this system, trying to continue.
   #+END_EXAMPLE
   
   Copy the whole line and paste it in external terminal emulator. When I ran it in external terminal outside emacs, it worked without any issues. Make sure thought, you have automake, autobuild installed (in Mac throught HomeBrew). Above link has proper instructions for windows as well.
