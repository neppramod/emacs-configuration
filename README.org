* Emacs Configuration
** Installation
 - Install *emacs*
 - Download this repository to ~.emacs.d~ folder (in your home directory) \\ 
   ~git clone git@github.com:neppramod/emacs-configuration.git ~/.config/doom -b doom-emacs~
 - *Note*: /In windows, home directory is at C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming. AppData folder is hidden by default/ \\
 - Only adjustment you may need to do is setup proper font
** Details
  - Read [[configuration/configuration.org][configuration/configuration.org]], and go through each section on how things are set. I believe it is well documented. Github also loads org file in proper displayable format, so it should be easy to follow.
