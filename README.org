* Emacs Configuration
** Installation
 - Install *emacs*
 - Download this repository to ~.emacs.d~ folder (in your home directory) \\ 
   ~git clone https://github.com/neppramod/emacs-configuration.git .emacs.d~
 - *Note*: /In windows, home directory is at C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming. AppData folder is hidden by default/ \\
 - Link or copy ~emacs.muban~ to ~.emacs.muban~ and put it outside *.emacs.d* in home directory. Assuming you are in ~ or AppData directory \\
   ~ln -s .emacs.d/emacs.muban .emacs.muban~
 - Install the font mentioned in [[https://github.com/neppramod/emacs-configuration/blob/master/configuration.org#font][Font section]] of ~configuration.org~
 - Open emacs. Emacs will install required packages and load other settings in ~init.el~ and [[configuration.org][configuration.org]]
 - If emacs prompts for continue connecting? Select *a* (always)
 - Edit a file and make some changes. Save and quit
 - If emacs asks for Save desktop ? Select *y* (yes) (If it asks for a directory, create a blank directory and enter that location)
 
** Details
  - Read [[configuration.org][configuration.org]], and go through each section on how things are set. I believe it is well documented. Github also loads org file in proper displayable format, so it should be easy to follow.
  - Few custom keys are set, and most of them are found in individual ~use-package~ or [[https://github.com/neppramod/emacs-configuration/blob/master/configuration.org#key-bindings][Key bindings section]]. Usage of default keys are listed in individual Notes section and global [[https://github.com/neppramod/emacs-configuration/blob/master/configuration.org#notes-2][Notes]] section.
  - You may also want to configure [[https://github.com/neppramod/emacs-configuration/blob/master/configuration.org#personal][Personal]] section to your liking. It is easy to copy paste and change those settings. Specially make sure org file directory is setup correctly. Default is set to ~/Dropbox/org. If you don't want to setup org-mode note taking, you can delete that part.
  - Some of the operating system specific portions are in individual files like linux.el, mac.el and windows.el. Feel free to change them to match your system and directories.
